It understands who we are who we are, what we want and why. A world full of opportunities opens itself for us. Smart AI systems will provide us with insights we would never have thought possible and give answers to questions we did not even know existed. Prosperity, time-saving and ease are the sweet fruits, but there might be a few bad apples"

You are probably carrying around a whole shopping mall in your pocket right now. A shopping mall that never closes. Millions of products right at your fingertips. In this talk we look back at how information technology changed shopping as we know it today. How did we get there? What are the key technologies that facilitate online shops at the scale of, for example, Amazon, Zalando and bol.com? And we believe we are only at the beginning. The best has yet to come. So, we also peek at how upcoming technologies such as machine learning, augmented reality and blockchain will impact your shopping experience of tomorrow."

His believe that you should not only practice what you preach, but also practice before you preach, made him decide to move to industry. He loves to combine his research skills with his pragmatic nature to discover new technologies and original ways to solve everyday problems, and has been doing just that for more than six years now. First for the banking and insurance industry, and recently, for bol.com: the biggest online retailer of Belgium and the Netherlands.",

He studied computer science at the Universities of Utrecht and Amsterdam and enjoys explaining complex IT-systems or concepts as simple as possible. In doing so, he likes to exaggerate in all his analogies."

Around 2005 he became interested in large-scale electronic implementations of brain-inspired computer architectures. His group pioneered several innovations in the field. He led 2 major European initiatives, FACETS and BrainScaleS. In 2009 he was one of the initiators of the European Human Brain Project (HBP) that was approved in 2013. In the HBP he leads the subproject on neuromorphic computing with the goal of establishing brain-inspired computing paradigms as research tools for neuroscience and generic hardware systems for cognitive computing.

Winand Slingenbergh will share some of his personal experiences in working with the most common type of 3D printers and take a critical look at the current limitations, providing a reality check to the many misconceptions.",

Though many myths surrounding 3D printing will be dispelled, there is still much unexplored potential when it comes to automated production and will end with a view of what ubiquitous 3D printing might mean for the average consumer in the near future."
