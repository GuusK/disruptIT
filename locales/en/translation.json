As every year, this symposium is aimed at teaching students about a topical theme in the field of Computer Science. The students attending this year's symposium will get to know everything about autonomous systems. Within the field of Computer Science autonomous systems are quickly gaining ground. Even in your daily life these systems are encountered everywhere. More and more machines are equipped with sensors and computers are becoming increasingly intelligent. Fully self-driving cars are already a reality in labs and cars on the roads are packed with technology which makes driving near to autonomous. The need of human intervention is becoming something of the past. These and more subsections of the field of autonomy will be thoroughly discussed during the symposium."
