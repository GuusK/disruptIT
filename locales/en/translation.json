On this yearly symposium we will get to the bottom of an actual theme within the field of Computer Science. This year we choose autonomy as theme of the symposium. Nowadays everything needs to be more efficient and if possible even without human interference. Therefore the field of autonomous software and hardware is quickly developing to fulfill the demands of this new market. The first autonomous cars been tested on the Dutch roads, and there are houses relying on robotica. We also predict that robots will be better at soccer than humans by 2050."

Since there are even too few spaces for members of these associations tickets can only be bought by members of the foundation. A special exception has been made for STORM and CognAC, who both want to join the foundation. The tickets will be available at all of these associations long before the event. Please ask the board of your association for more information about how to get tickets.",
                "p #[strong When.] The symposium will take place at the 23 november 2015. We have checked with all the associations who are able to sell tickets and you will probably not be in an exam week at that time which gives you plenty of time to do some extra interesting, extra curricular events and come to Eindhoven at the 23#[sup rd].",
                "p #[strong Where.] For the first time ever the SNiC symposium will be hosted in Eindhoven. Were we normally choose a location near Utrecht we now try to host the symposium at the Evoluon in Eindhoven. Its one of the most awesome ventures in the Netherlands and hope to host a symposium there which is just as awesome.",
