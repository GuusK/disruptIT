          | Some examples of the accomplishments of Nedap’s developers are the access control system of the Eiffel Tower, LED-based water purification for the city of New York, traffic control systems for the city of Amsterdam and RFID systems for worldwide fashion retailers such as River Island and H&M. This year, the Library Solutions team won a prestigious Red Dot Design Award for the simplicity and smoothness of their latest product. In general, an important characteristic of every Nedap product, is the unobtrusive way it can be used. It simply works, has more features and is future proof.

        h2 A flock of birds
        .separator(role='separator')
        p Nedap is known for its culture of not having the hierarchical layers of management or ‘bosses’ you might expect in a global tech firm. Instead it’s a big pool of talented technology and marketing developers, creating innovative products in self-managing teams. At Nedap, you’re in control from day one.

        p CEO Ruben Wegman likes to compare Nedap to a flock of birds. 'We hire the smartest people in the country and rely on them to tell us where we should go, or what we should be developing. Having said that, a bright mind is not enough. If you can't think as an entrepreneur or work independently, you should not be in our flock.'

      p Andre: 'At Nedap we believe that people make the difference. Both in our own company and in the things we build, we focus on trust and giving back control wherever possible. Rules are restrictive and stop people from making their own decisions. We help companies to set people free through technology and simply watch what happens. It is magical.'
