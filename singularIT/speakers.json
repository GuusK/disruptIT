        "Technology firms often seem inspired by the science fiction genre, and are nowadays building technologies first described within novels of the 60, 70s, and 80s, whether it be robotics, facial recognition technology or virtual reality systems. Science fiction, though, has often been reluctant to elaborate much on future finance and money.",

How does money and finance relate to the futuristic concept of 'the singularity', and how does finance interact with virtual reality, internet-of-things and technological megacorporations?"

      "talk": ["To increase computing power, computer chips get crammed with ever-growing numbers of transistors. But miniaturization makes chips vulnerable to undesirable quantum-mechanical effects that prevent them from behaving in the intended 'classical' way. Celebrated proposals of Feynman and Deutsch from the 1980s suggested that, instead of fighting these effects, we should use them to our advantage and design computers based on their principles, giving birth to the currently thriving field of quantum computing. In this talk I will introduce the basic ideas behind quantum information processing and discuss some of its most striking applications and phenomena."],

He obtained his PhD from CWI and the University of Amsterdam in 2011 and was a post-doc at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University on an NWO Rubicon Fellowship. His research lies in the intersection of theoretical computer science and mathematics, and often involves quantum algorithms, entanglement, coding theory, approximation algorithms, Banach spaces, and additive combinatorics. For his PhD thesis he was awarded the Stieltjes prize and the Andreas Bonn medal.

This genome directs the cell’s function and behaviour, superficially much like a computer program. Most of today’s biological science revolves around understanding the genetic program. These studies have been transformed by the emergence of genomics – the large-scale study of the genome. The key technology enabling this revolution is DNA sequencing, which will soon allow any organism’s genes to be studied at any time. In parallel, new technologies for editing the genome have recently been invented. In this talk, I will explore these developments, and discuss how they will become part of our future lives."],

Subsequently, he specialized in genomics, and for the past ten years has used DNA sequencing technologies to study a wide variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria to snakes (and including quite a few fish species). Currently, he is a research scientist at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Oslo, where he leads studies on fish developmental biology. In addition, he continues to collaborate with Leiden-based companies Future Genomics Technologies and BaseClear on the tulip genome."],
